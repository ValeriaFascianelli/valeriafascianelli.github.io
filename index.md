  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <div class="about-text">
     <p>
        I am a physicist by training and currently a postdoctoral researcher in computational neuroscience in Stefano Fusi’s lab at Columbia University, New York.
      </p>
      <p>
       I collaborate closely with experimentalists to understand neural mechanisms and computational principles of cognitive processes, such as decision-making, and to characterize emotional states.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my postdoctoral work, I have been developing a representational geometry framework to uncover individual cognitive strategies in
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50503-w" target="_blank">primate prefrontal cortex</a>,
        probe decision-making computations in
        <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.13.612926v1" target="_blank">cerebellar Purkinje cells</a>,
        and characterize internal states following stress events in the
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08241-y" target="_blank">amygdala and hippocampus</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build interpretable, data-driven models using machine learning, dynamical-systems modeling, and decoding analyses to understand how the geometry of neural activity shapes behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, during my Ph.D. in Neuroscience, I quantified intrinsic neural timescales across cortical areas and the basal ganglia to reveal how slow and fast dynamics support distinct computations. Before transitioning into neuroscience, I earned an M.Sc. in particle physics and worked at CERN on rare K⁺ meson decays and heavy-neutrino searches—running Monte Carlo simulations and developing real-time trigger algorithms.
