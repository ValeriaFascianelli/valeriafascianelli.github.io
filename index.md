      <p>I am a physicist by training and currently a postdoctoral researcher in Stefano Fusi’s lab at Columbia University, New York.</p>
      <p>In my postdoctoral work, I have been developing a representational geometry framework to uncover individual cognitive strategies in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50503-w" target="_blank">primate prefrontal cortex</a>, probe decision-making computations in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.13.612926v1" target="_blank">cerebellar Purkinje cells</a>, and characterize internal states following stress events in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08241-y" target="_blank">amygdala and hippocampus</a>.</p>
      <p>I build interpretable, data-driven models using machine learning, dynamical-systems modeling, and decoding analyses to understand how the geometry of neural activity shapes behavior and emotion.</p>
      <p>Previously, during my Ph.D. in Neuroscience, I quantified intrinsic neural timescales across cortical areas and the basal ganglia to reveal how slow and fast dynamics support distinct computations. Before transitioning into neuroscience, I earned an M.Sc. in particle physics and worked at CERN on rare K⁺ meson decays and heavy-neutrino searches—running Monte Carlo simulations and developing real-time trigger algorithms.</p>
